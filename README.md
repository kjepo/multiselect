# multiselect #

## Description ##

This plugin is useful when a user has to select from, e.g., multiple dropdown lists but certain combinations of selected items are illegal.

## Example ##

Let's look at a practical example: a company is selling t-shirts and the user has to select size, color, text and text color.  
The company may not want to sell a white t-shirt with white text, or a black t-shirt with black text.  With this plugin, you can specify such illegal combinations so that the user won't even able to click on "black text" when he/she has first selected black as the t-shirt color.
Choices can be made in any order, but as soon as potential illegal combinations are possible, those choices are dimmed out.
